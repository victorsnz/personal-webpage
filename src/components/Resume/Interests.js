        <p>Apart from development and playing with Arduino boards, there are a bunch of things that I like (in case you want to know me a little more):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Listening to Music and Podcasts</b></li>
            <p>I love 80's music! my favourite bands are <b>Depeche Mode</b>, <b>The Cure</b>, and <b>The Smiths</b>. I enjoy listening to music while coding, <i>Space Rock</i> and <i>Synthwave</i> are excellent genres to listen while working on projects.<br/>
            I listen to podcast about Coding, English Speaking, and True Crime.
            </p>
            <li><b>Watching Series and Movies</b></li>
            <p>My favourite movie of all time is <b>Back to the Future</b> but as a horror fan I am always looking for a good horror movie to watch.<br/>
            Regarding series, my favourite one is <b>Doctor Who</b>, but I like a bunch of series of different genres.
            </p>
            <li><b>Reading Books and Comics</b></li>
            <p>My favourite writers are Stephen King, Edgar Allan Poe and H. P. Lovecraft (I told you, I'm a horror fan), my favourite books are <b>IT</b>, <b>The Shining</b>, and <b>Psycho</b>.<br/>
            I like comics too, they have super interesting stories.</p>
            <li><b>Hanging out with friends</b></li>
            <p>Meeting people is important, and I enjoy meeting my friends for a good chat (or colleages for a hackathon or so)</p>
        </ul>
